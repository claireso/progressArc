# progressArc

ProgressArc is a jQuery plugin that allows you to draw a visual loader.

You can control the loader using the `setProgress` custom event and get the current progress value using the `change` custom event.

The user can interact with the arc using his mouse or his finger. So you can use this plugin not just for visual loader but like for exemple a player volume control (like on the [pitchfork player](http://pitchfork.com/) ).
